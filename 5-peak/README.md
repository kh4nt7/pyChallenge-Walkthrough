When I searched for .p file in google, I found python pickles<br/>
banner.p seems to be data dumped by the pickle <br/>
I loaded the pickle and assign to a data using `http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/banner.p`<br/>

What we find is a dictonary with '#'`[hash]` and ' '`[space]`<br/>
Hummm, ... <br/>
Hint is banner and so, these dict seems to be a banner <br/>
each line compressed into a dictionary<br/>
If we print out every key,value pairs in dictionary as a line<br/>
We got this <br/>
